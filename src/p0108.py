# solution based on the following observation
# if 1/x + 1/y = 1/n then ny + nx = xy
# <=> n^2 + nx + ny - xy = n^2
# <=> (n - x)(n - y) = n^2
# this means that any pair of the form (x, y) = (n + a, n + b) is a solution if ab = n^2
# to find the number of solutions, we need to find the number of unique ways one can write n^2 as a product
# we know by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that n = p_1^{a_1} * ... * p_i^{a_i}
# hence n^2 = p_1^{2a_1} * ... * p_i^{2a_i}
# the number of valid pairs is then 1 + (2a_1 + 1) * ... * (2a_1 + 1) / 2, the number of unique partitions of this set
# since we double count (wlog, a <= b), we have to divide by two
# but we must add 1 since a = b = n is only counted once
